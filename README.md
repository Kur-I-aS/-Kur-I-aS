#  Hey, I'm Kurias — your friendly neighborhood bug exorcist.  
### Full-Stack-ish Engineer • Backend Summoner • PHP/JS Survivor

I build systems, break them, fix them, refactor them, sometimes all in the same day.  
If code is chaos, then I am the storm. 🌪️

##  My Core Abilities (Unlocked Over Many Boss Fights)

**Backend Magic:** PHP • JavaScript • Node.js • Python (work in progress 👶⚙️)

**Framework Spells:**  
CodeIgniter 4 (my home planet) • Laravel • Express.js • Django • CI3 migration wizard

**Database Diplomacy:**  
PostgreSQL (likes structure) • MySQL (likes drama)

**Frontend Shenanigans:**  
HTML • CSS • jQuery  
(React? Maybe later. My sanity is important.)

**Bonus Chaos Powers:**  
REST APIs • PDF sorcery (mPDF + Dompdf)  
Linux CLI (where real developers cry)  
Debugging ~ nightmares ~ adventures  
UI/UX — when I feel like being artistic instead of logical

##  Legendary Quests (Projects That Survived)

###  Node.js Mailer App 📧  
My attempt to send emails without begging Gmail to “please work PLEASE WORK.”  
Includes tokens, validation, clean structure, and zero hardcoded passwords.  
(We don’t talk about v1.)

---

###  Court Case Information System ⚖️  
A legal system so organized it made lawyers breathe calmly for once.  
PDF exports included because printers deserve pain too.

---

###  CI3 → CI4 Migration Toolkit 🌀
I fought legacy code and won.  
Sessions were broken. Controllers were cursed.  
But now everything is shiny and maintainable.  
CI3 cried. CI4 cheered.

---

###  Thesis Tracking System 📚  
Built for university faculty who needed *another* dashboard.  
Used by real humans. No refunds.

---

###  TellMe — Android Greeting App 📱 
A wholesome app that greets you based on time of day and throws motivational quotes at you so you don’t quit coding.

---

##  Currently Grinding XP In:
- Python (aim: level up to “dangerous”)  
- System design (because interviews exist 😭)  
- Cloud things ☁️  
- Reading huge codebases without losing sanity  
- AI/automation workflows  

---

##  My Philosophy  
Write code.  
Ship code.  
Break code.  
Fix code.  
Repeat until lunch.

If I don’t respond, I’m probably debugging something that *should not* logically be possible.

##  Collaboration? Yes.  
If your project has:  
✔ Chaos  
✔ Unclear documentation  
✔ Legacy code  
✔ API drama  
✔ Strange bugs  
✔ Mysterious errors  

Congratulations.  
That’s my favorite environment.

Let’s build awkward, beautiful things together. ✨
