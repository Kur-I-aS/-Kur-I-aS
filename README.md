#  Hey, I'm Kurias  
###  Software Engineer • Backend Overlord • Professional Bug Negotiator

I create applications, refactor chaos, and occasionally summon stack traces that were never meant to be seen by humans.

If your system is held together by duct tape, prayers, and legacy code—  
**perfect. I’m already interested.**

###  Framework Shenanigans  
- CodeIgniter 4 (favorite child)  
- Laravel (sometimes behaves)  
- Express.js (got in mid-way) 
- React.js (Node chaos mode)  
- Django (the adult in the room)

##  Featured Projects (the ones that fought me but I won)

### **📧 Node.js Mailer App**  
A mini email-sending beast.  
Built with Express, validation, tokens, and structure so clean it smells like fresh commits.  
v1 was a disaster.  
v2 works.

---

### **⚖️ Court Case Information System**  
A legal management system that could survive attorneys, clerks, and the general chaos of government workflows.  
PDF exports included, because printers need punishment.

---

### **🌀 CI3 → CI4 Migration Toolkit**  
Legacy Code + Coffee + Several Existential Crises = Migration Success  
Sessions fixed, models reorganized, controllers purified.  
CI4 = happy. CI3 = crying in the corner.

---

### **📚 Thesis Tracking System**  
Made for universities. Used by real professors.  
UI so clean even non-tech faculty used it without calling me.

---

### **📱 TellMe – Android Greeting App**  
A sweet, innocent app that tells you good morning.  
The opposite of my debugging sessions.

---

##  Currently Grinding XP:
- Python (leveling from “beginner” → “dangerously productive”)
- Large codebase archaeology  
- Cloud wizardry  
- Reading 18-module systems without screaming  
- AI workflows + automation

##  Philosophy of Code  

try {
  make it work;
} catch (chaos) {
  fix it again;
} finally {
  commit anyway;
}

##  Contact Me  
🔗 LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/kurias-jose

If you message me and I don’t reply, I’m debugging a feature that stopped working for *absolutely no reason*.

##  Final Message  
If your project needs:  
- debugging  
- refactoring  
- architecture help  
- or someone brave enough to open the "legacy" folder  

**Call me.**

Let’s create something beautiful (and slightly chaotic).
